# Breat-Tumour-Classification-using-KNN-and-Feature-Engineering
This project is focused on the classification of breast tumours using the KNN classifier with feature engineering techniques such as PCA, LDA, and StandardScaler. For this project, I toyed with the Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set to improve the performance of the classification model.
